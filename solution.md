###ETL Process for Product Customer and cart Data
This project provides an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process for Product, Cart, and Customer data. The design emphasizes modularity and extensibility, allowing for various input and output formats. It incorporates comprehensive unit tests to ensure the application's robust functionality.
This project is using Dockerised Apache spark 3.5.0 job to Transform the data, process it and store the results into postgreSQL database

###Analytical Insight
The implemented model facilitates the exploration of several analytical questions relating to sales, customer behavior, and product management. A few potential inquiries include:

###Sales Analysis:
Identification of top-selling products by quantity or revenue
Tracking the sales performance of specific products or variations over time
Calculation of average purchase quantity per customer
Examination of the impact of seasonal changes on product sales

###Customer Behavior Analysis:
Determining the most active customers in terms of purchases
Understanding the average purchase frequency across different customer segments
Analyzing the influence of different product variations on customer preferences and behavior
Evaluating the average cart size for distinct customer segments

###Product Management Analysis:
Recognition of the most popular product variations within specific categories
Assessment of the impact of product pricing changes on overall sales and customer behavior
Identification of products with the highest and lowest customer engagement based on sales and quantity data
Calculation of the average time taken for a product to transition from creation to purchase

###Business Case Assumptions
Product data includes attributes such as ID, name, price, SKU, and creation date.
Customer data contains ID, name, and creation date.
Cart data encompasses details about products in the cart, including ID, product ID, customer ID, quantity, creation date, and deletion date.
Destination models store processed data in a standardized format for further analysis and reporting.
The SKU in the destination table for products holds data up to the "-" separator, adaptable based on future requirements.
The product_variation_id auto-increments from 1 as a surrogate key, subject to modification as per business needs.
Scaling Considerations
The solution effectively manages tables with millions of rows by leveraging appropriate indexing, partitioning, and optimized querying strategies. Efficient data retrieval is facilitated using indexed columns and multi-level partitioning.

###Installation
To install and run the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository.
Use the provided shell and batch files within the Pyspark-Postgres-Plato-Etl_latest directory for specific tasks.
Run start.sh or start.bat file to initiate the Docker environment.
Run stop.sh or stop.bat file to halt the Docker environment.
Execute the submit.sh or submit.bat script with the designated job name to start the ETL process.
bash
Copy code
./submit.bat cart_data_transform

###Testing
The application includes a comprehensive suite of unit tests to ensure the proper functioning of the ETL process. To execute the tests, follow these steps:

Access the Docker container's bash shell by executing the following command within the spark_etl directory:
bash
Copy code
docker exec -it <container_name> /bin/bash
Navigate to the /spark_etl/tests directory and run the following command:
bash
Copy code
pytest

to check code coverage
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html

###Future Enhancements:
Template-based Data Mapping: Enables seamless integration with various source and target systems, enhancing flexibility and adaptability.
Target Data Structure Creation: Dynamic creation of target data structures using configuration files, streamlining the ETL process and accommodating diverse data formats.
Test Automation: Comprehensive test automation for unit test cases and integration test suites, ensuring the reliability and stability of the ETL pipeline.

###Scalability Considerations:
Data Retention Period Definition: Critical for managing large datasets, defining an appropriate data retention period aids in maintaining data integrity and optimizing storage resources.

End-of-Life Product Identification: Identifying products at the end of their life cycle and discontinued customers facilitates effective inventory management and customer relationship strategies.

Code Coverage Enhancement: Striving for a higher level of code coverage ensures robustness and reliability in data processing and analysis, enhancing the overall quality of the ETL pipeline.
